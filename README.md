# Crowdfunding_ETL

### Description
For the ETL mini project, we built an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and both Python dictionary methods (João) and regular expressions (Crimson) to extract and transform the data. We transformed the data, creating four CSV files that we exported into the Resources folder. Then, we used the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, we uploaded the CSV file data into a Postgres database using the import/extract data gui button built in Postgres. The sql files can be found in the SQL folder. We also included screenshots in the SQL folder of the data being retrieved from the Postgres database.
